# PSA entropy source driver interface

The accelerator interface lets you drivers for entropy sources such as Hardware Random Number Generators (HRNG), also known as True Random Number Generators (TRNG), into an implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](../#application-programming-interface).

**Status: draft** â€” major changes are still likely.

**Documentation**: for now, please see the header file:
[`include/psa/crypto_entropy_driver.h`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/development/include/psa/crypto_entropy_driver.h)
