<h1 id="psa-entropy-source-driver-interface">PSA entropy source driver interface</h1>
<p>The accelerator interface lets you drivers for entropy sources such as Hardware Random Number Generators (HRNG), also known as True Random Number Generators (TRNG), into an implementation of the <a href="../#application-programming-interface">PSA Cryptography API</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Status: draft</strong> â€” major changes are still likely.</p>
