<h1 id="psa-secure-element-driver-interface">PSA secure element driver interface</h1>
<p>The accelerator interface lets you drivers for external cryptoprocessors into an implementation of the <a href="../#application-programming-interface">PSA Cryptography API</a>. External cryptoprocessors such as secure elements and smart cards perform cryptographic operations with keys accessed via opaque handles.</p>
<p><strong>Status: draft</strong> â€” major changes are still likely.</p>
